## 🧠 Technical Architecture Deep Dive

### **1. Advanced LSTM + Attention Model**
```python
Input (60 timesteps, 25 features)
    ↓
Bidirectional LSTM (128 units) + Dropout + BatchNorm
    ↓  
Bidirectional LSTM (64 units) + Dropout + BatchNorm
    ↓
Bidirectional LSTM (32 units) + Dropout + BatchNorm
    ↓
Custom Attention Layer (64 units)
    ↓
Global Average Pooling (parallel path)
    ↓
Concatenate Attention + GlobalAvg
    ↓
Dense (128) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout
    ↓
Dense (64) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout
    ↓
Dense (32) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout
    ↓

```

**Why This Architecture is Superior:**
- **Bidirectional Processing**: Captures both historical patterns and future context
- **Attention Mechanism**: Automatically focuses on most relevant time periods
- **Multi-layer Depth**: Learns hierarchical representations
- **Regularization**: Prevents overfitting with dropout, batch norm, L1/L2

### **3. Time Series Validation Strategy**
```python
Time Series Cross-Validation (5 folds):
Fold 1: Train[0:200]    → Test[260:290]
Fold 2: Train[0:300]    → Test[360:390] 
Fold 3: Train[0:400]    → Test[460:490]
Fold 4: Train[0:500]    → Test[560:590]
Fold 5: Train[0:600]    → Test[660:690]

Walk-Forward Analysis:
Train[0:600] → Predict[601]
Train[0:601] → Predict[602]  
Train[0:602] → Predict[603]
... (incremental updates)

Purged Cross-Validation:
- Embargo period: 5 days
- Removes samples too close in time
- Prevents autocorrelation leakage
```

### **4. Hybrid Online Learning**
```python
Incremental Fine-Tuning:
- Trigger: Every 50-100 new samples
- Learning Rate: 0.0001 (adaptive)
- Epochs: 3-5 (quick adaptation)
- Buffer Size: 10,000 samples max
- Sampling: Quality-weighted recent data

Full Retraining Triggers:
- Time-based: Weekly schedule
- Performance: >15% degradation
- Data volume: >10,000 new samples
- Market regime: Volatility changes

Adaptive Learning Rate:
current_lr = base_lr * volatility_factor * performance_factor
- Increases in stable markets
- Decreases in volatile periods
- Adjusts based on recent losses
```
